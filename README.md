> Project includes a README file that explains the following:
A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is
Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project
The readme should be called readme.md or readme.txt and located in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project on GitHub
Choose at least 1 item on the CSS Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 item off the list of JavaScript Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 additional item from any of the lists below and implement it in your project
We recommend you pick a 4th item (or more!) to add, just in case something goes wrong with one of your other items - 3 is only the minimum requirement

## CSS Features
1. ### CSS Grid 

> Use CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.

2. ### CSS FLexbox

3. ### :nth-child 

> Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 

4. ### CSS Animation 

>Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you will have to research this on your own


## Javascript Features

1. ### Create a form, validate at least one field, and then use that information on your page somehow.

Enter player name

> Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.

2. ### JavaScript mathematical function and displays.

Get Random Number, Add score to previous score.

> Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.

3. ### Create and populate a JavaScript array and display.

Array of 6 random numbers, display as Dice SVG

> Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page

4. ### Create a Javascript loop that displays HTML.

Displays player names, removes empty

> Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example displaying a number of list items <li> based on how many times you loop

5. ### Show/hide one or more content areas or elements.

> Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.
