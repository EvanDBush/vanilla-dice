# Vanilla Dice

> Project includes a README file that explains the following:
A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is
### A dice game designed to share with friends. There are six dice total. To roll a lesser number of dice, click to highlight the dice you do not want to roll. Then click the "Roll Dice" button. Suggested Rules are displayed when the "Rules" button in clicked.
***
Please try out the game at <a href="https://evandbush.github.io/">my project's Github site!</a>
***

The inspiration for this project came from playing dice with my family over Zoom. We did it, but it was difficult. Everyone had to have a set of six dice to play and it was hard to roll in a way everyone could see. With this site. no physical dice are needed and everyone can display their own set of dice.

<p>The dice are styled so that each dice face is a set color. This makes matching numbers easier to spot.</p>

<p>This is an advantage over typical monochromatic physical dice. One of the aspects I miss about physical dice is the suspense in rolling, a computer is just too fast. If you have any suggestions on fun ways to add suspense, I'd love to hear them!</p>

## CSS Features
>Choose at least 1 item on the CSS Features List below and implement it in your project

***
***
1. #### CSS Grid

***
***
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto; align-items: center">
<div style="float: left; margin: 10px 4px 10px 4px;">
    First I started out with a two column view for mobile devices. On small screens, all dice and the roll button are visible. If the user scrolls down to the players score box, they can click the tag at the bottom of the page to jump back to the top.
    
    .grid-box {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 150px 150px;
        column-gap: 2%;
        row-gap: 1%;
        justify-items: center;
    }
The items are then assigned a column position and fit themselves into rows in the order they are written.
        
    .first-grid-position {
        grid-column: 1;
    }
    .second-grid-position {
        grid-column: 2;
    }

</div>

<div>

<img src="img/views/mobile-view.png">
</div>

***
***


<div>
    For larger screens I added a third column to fill the space better and make room for more content below. Inside this space, the rules and scoring box is displayed all the time. 

<img src="img/views/rules-box-full-view.png">
</div>

<div>

    @media (min-width: 1000px) {
    .grid-box {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns:  
                155px 155px 155px;
            column-gap: 2%;
            row-gap: 2%;
            justify-self: left;
            justify-items: center;
            margin: 0%;
        }
    };  
</div>

</div>

> Use CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.
***
***
2. #### CSS Flexbox

***
***

By styling the main section with flexbox, the individual content containers fill the space better at different screen sizes. At first, the containers are displayed one-after-another in a single column. The main functions of the game are available in the initial page display. 
```
main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-around;
    padding: 2%;
}
```
As space becomes available, the player score container comes up to the same line as the dice. The flex direction is changed to row reverse to keep the rules displayed along the bottom. The score container is used more frequently.
```
main {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        justify-content: space-around;
        padding: 2%;
        margin: 5%;
    }

    article {
        flex-basis: auto ;
        min-width: 300px;
        max-height: fit-content;
    }
```
At large screen sizes, all the content can be displayed in a single row. The order is slighly changed so that the dice remain in the center and the players-box displays on the left. Rules display on the right.
***
***
3. #### :nth-of-tyoe

***
***

<div width=50% style="float: right">



> Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 

</div>

<img src="img/views/player-box-mobile.png" width="50%" style= "float: right">
This project uses ":nth-of-type"  to style the player names and scores to add some variety to a basic list.

```
.inert-player:nth-of-type(2n) {
    background-color: #cc9263;
    color: #ffe4a3;
}
```
Border and text color are used to indicate the active player. When the game is played by less than 8 players, addPlayers() removes the extra player boxes.

```
for (let namePosition = 8; 
    namePosition > totalPlayers; 
    namePosition= namePosition-1) 
        {document.querySelector(`#player-name-${namePosition}`)
        .style.display = 'none';};
```

## Javascript Features

***
***
>Choose at least 1 item off the list of JavaScript Features List below and implement it in your project

1. ### Create a form, validate at least one field, and then use that information on your page somehow.

Enter player name

> Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.



```
function submitScore() {
    const playerElement = document.getElementById("player-name-" +totalPointsBox);
    const pointsElement = document.getElementById("p" +totalPointsBox+ "-points");
    let enteredScore = parseInt(document.getElementById("score-input").value);
        if (totalPointsBox < totalPlayers) {
            let nextPlayer = document.getElementById("player-name-" + (totalPointsBox + 1));
            pointsElement.innerHTML = enteredScore + parseInt(pointsElement.innerHTML);
            playerElement.setAttribute("class", "inert-player");
            nextPlayer.setAttribute("class", "active-player");
            totalPointsBox = totalPointsBox + 1;
        } else {  
            totalPointsBox = totalPlayers;
            pointsElement.innerHTML = enteredScore + parseInt(pointsElement.innerHTML);
            playerElement.setAttribute("class", "inert-player");
            totalPointsBox = 1;
            let nextPlayer = document.getElementById("player-name-" + totalPointsBox);
            nextPlayer.setAttribute("class", "active-player");
        };  
    document.getElementById("score-input").value = 0;
};
```
***
***
2. ### JavaScript mathematical function and displays.
***
***
> Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.

This Javascript funtion calculates a random number between 1 and 6. First, a random decimal is obtained from the `Math.random()` funtion. Then, that number is multipled by 6 to give us a number with a decimal between 0 and 6. The `Math.floor()` funtion turns that number into a whole number between 0 and 5. By adding 1, a random number between 1 and 6 is produced. This corresponds easily to a dice face to display on the page.

`let myRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() *6) + 1;`


***
***
3. ### Create and populate a JavaScript array and display.
***
***
> Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page

The first part of the function creates a random number (1-6) and pushes it into an array. The function repeats for each of six dice positions. 



```
function rollDice () {

    let randomArray = [];
    
        for (let dicePosition = 0; dicePosition < 6; dicePosition++) {
            let myRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() *6) + 1;
            randomArray.push(myRoll);
```
The contents of the array line up with a dice face in a .svg file.
```
let diceSVG = `img/small-dice/face${randomArray[dicePosition]}.svg`;

```   
After `randomArray[]` is created, the index of the array lines up with the dice positions(+1). 
```
    if (document.getElementById(`dice${dicePosition + 1}`)
```
The dice position the function is on gets set with an SVG. It's name has the same random number given by the array.   

```
            document.querySelector(`.face${dicePosition}`)
            .setAttribute('src', diceSVG);
```

****
****
4. ### Create a Javascript loop that displays HTML.
****
****
> Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example displaying a number of list items based on how many times you loop


Displays player names, removes empty

```
function addPlayers () {
    let totalPlayers = parseInt(prompt('How many players? (1-8)'));
        for (let namePosition = 0; 
            namePosition < totalPlayers;
            namePosition++) {
            let playerName = 
            prompt(`Enter a name for Player${namePosition + 1}`);
            document.querySelector(`#player${namePosition + 1}`).innerHTML = 
            playerName;
        }; 
        for (let namePosition = 8;
            namePosition > totalPlayers; 
            namePosition= namePosition-1) {
            document.querySelector(`#player-name-${namePosition}`)
            .style.display = 'none';
        };
};
```


****
****
5. ### Show/hide one or more content areas or elements.
****
****
> Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.


```
let ruleBox = document.getElementById("rule-box");
let ruleButton = document.getElementById("rule-button");

function showRules () {
    if (ruleBox.className === "hide") {
        ruleBox.setAttribute("class", "show");
    } else {
        ruleBox.setAttribute("class", "hide")} 
};
```
